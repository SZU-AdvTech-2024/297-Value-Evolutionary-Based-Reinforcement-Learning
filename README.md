## Overview

VEB-RL is a hybrid framework designed for value-based reinforcement learning methods. It integrates genetic algorithms (GA) and cross-entropy method (CEM) to enhance the learning process using TD error as a fitness metric for more accurate value function approximation. The Elite Interaction Mechanism is also proposed to improve sample quality, significantly enhancing the performance of value-based RL across various tasks.
